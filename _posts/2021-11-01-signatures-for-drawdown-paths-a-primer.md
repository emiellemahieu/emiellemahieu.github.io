My other projects hinge on the concepts of **paths** and **path signatures** as prerequisites. In the words of Terry Lyons[^1]:

> The key idea behind signatures is to stop thinking about a path as a quantity evolving over time, but rather as an object that you can query over intervals. As one queries these intervals, one gets a natural description about what happens with the system at different time scales.

The primer (based on [Chevyrev et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03788)) compiles my notes from a literature review on the signature transform, and includes two examples related to portfolio drawdown:

- Classifying high- and low-drawdown stocks in terms of next period expectation using signature transformed previous period paths as features.
- Distinguishing between high- and low-codrawdown regimes using signature embedded paths.
