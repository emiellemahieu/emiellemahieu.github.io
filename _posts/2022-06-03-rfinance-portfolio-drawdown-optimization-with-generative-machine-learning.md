This short paper was presented at the 2022 R/Finance conference in Chicago, IL. It picks one of the above-mentioned architectures - a CVAE - and introduces a signature-based drawdown reconstruction cost loss term. The result is a host of realistic drawdown scenarios, where the optimal portfolio is defined as the ensemble expectation of min drawdown optimizers.
