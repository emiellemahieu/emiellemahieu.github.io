I"<p>My other projects hinge on the concepts of <strong>paths</strong> and <strong>path signatures</strong> as prerequisites. In the words of Terry Lyons[^1]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key idea behind signatures is to stop thinking about a path as a quantity evolving over time, but rather as an object that you can query over intervals. As one queries these intervals, one gets a natural description about what happens with the system at different time scales.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The primer (based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03788">Chevyrev et al. 2016</a>) compiles my notes from a literature review on the signature transform, and includes two examples related to portfolio drawdown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classifying high- and low-drawdown stocks in terms of next period expectation using signature transformed previous period paths as features.</li>
  <li>Distinguishing between high- and low-codrawdown regimes using signature embedded paths.</li>
</ul>
