I"ì<p><strong>Market generators</strong> are generative machine learning (ML) models with the specificity of modeling financial markets - such as stocksâ€™ spot markets, optionsâ€™ vol surfaces and limit order books (market microstructure).</p>

<p>The topic has seen a recent surge in interest, and this literature review provides a (non-exhaustive) list of the most important contributions in the field. Moreover, it discusses the following generative ML architectures in detail:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)</li>
  <li>Variational Autoencoders (VAE)</li>
  <li>Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)</li>
  <li>Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMN)</li>
  <li>Normalizing flow-based autoencoders (NF)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the literature review describes how each model can be conditioned on some exogenous state variables X to compose a conditional VAE (CVAE), conditional GAN (CGAN), etc. architecture. A good example would be to condition the simulation on the state-of-the-economy by including leading macro-economic indicators. In a portfolio construction context, the differences in optimal portfolios resulting from the conditional simulation can then be attributed to the conditions and sensitivities analyzed. A very simple example is included in the literature review.</p>
